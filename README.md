# My Car

MyCar is an app, where you can manage all appointments of your car and find car festivals in your region.
It saves all Appointments for you, so the history of your car is always saved and could be reached in seconds.

## Start using it


- Start by loggin in with github or google.
- Create your car! You can do it manually or by Vin (sadly, i had no API that allow unlimited acces to the VIN Decoder, so I moked it with a MongoDB, but i have just 5 cars saved there. If i find a open API i could implement that for the mocked database)
- Start adding your appointments
-You can Add documents and notes to each appointment individually on the detailsPage

## Have fun using my App!
